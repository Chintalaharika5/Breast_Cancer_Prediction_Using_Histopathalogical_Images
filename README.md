Breast Cancer Prediction Using Histopathological Images
üìå Project Overview
Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on automated breast cancer classification using histopathological images from the BreaKHis dataset. The study integrates deep learning-based feature extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers, incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and JAYA optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

üöÄ Key Features
Deep Learning Feature Extraction: Utilizes CNN and VGG16 models to extract meaningful features from histopathology images.
Machine Learning Classifiers: Implements Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) for classification.
Dimensionality Reduction: Uses PCA to retain 95% of variance while reducing feature dimensions.
Optimization: Employs JAYA optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve classifier performance.
Performance Evaluation: Compares different model combinations based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Dataset Preprocessing: Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and rescaling.
Feature Extraction: Extracting high-dimensional feature vectors using CNN and VGG16.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applying PCA to reduce redundancy while preserving key information.
Classification: Using RF, KNN, and XGB to classify images into benign or malignant.
Optimization: Implementing JAYA algorithm for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
